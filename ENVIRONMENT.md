# 🌍 Environmental Impact & Offset Analysis

## 1. The Core Trade-Off: Water vs. Carbon
Traditional data centers consume freshwater to cool chips. Project Moonshine consumes **Ethanol** (Corn/Grain) as a working fluid.

### The Math We Track
* **Metric A: WUE (Water Usage Effectiveness)**
    * *Standard Data Center:* Consumes ~1.8 Liters of water per kWh.
    * *Project Moonshine:* Consumes **0.0 Liters** per kWh (Closed Loop).
* **Metric B: Embodied Carbon of Fluid**
    * Producing 1 Gallon of Ethanol emits CO2 (farming/distilling).
    * *Offset Logic:* Does the energy saved by the turbine + the water saved by the loop outweigh the carbon cost of growing the corn for the ethanol?
    * *Target:* The system becomes carbon-neutral after [X] hours of operation due to energy recovery.

## 2. Waste & Byproduct Protocol ("The Flush")
Eventually, the working fluid will accumulate trace impurities (referred to in the project as "The Bourbon Glaze"). 
* **Chemical Composition:** The waste fluid is ~60% Ethanol, ~40% Water, plus trace copper oxides or atmospheric contaminants. **Note:** While we use the term "Bourbon," actual distilled spirits are never used as they contain sugars/tannins that foul the system.
* **Disposal Method:**
    * **Do NOT** dump in storm drains.
    * **Sanitary Sewer Safe:** In most municipalities, small quantities of diluted ethanol (under 24% ABV) can be poured down a sanitary sink drain with heavy water dilution, as it is biodegradable.
    * **Composting:** The "Bourbon Glaze" (precipitated oxides/solids) is 100% compostable.

## 3. Comparative Hazards
| Hazard | Glycol (Standard Coolant) | Moonshine (Our Coolant) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Toxicity** | Toxic to pets/humans (Kidney failure) | Non-Toxic (It's just strong liquor) |
| **Flammability** | Low | **High** (Requires strict sealing) |
| **Cleanup** | Hazmat Team | Mop & Bucket |

## 4. Feedstock Sourcing & Logistics
We analyze the "Seed-to-Server" impact of our working fluid.

### Logistics Break-even
A local feedstock (e.g., Corn) is not always the most environmental choice. We track:
* **Production Intensity:** The CO2/Water cost to grow and distill.
* **Logistics Intensity:** The CO2 cost to transport (Truck vs. Rail vs. Ship).

**The Rule of Thumb:** Highly efficient production (Sugarcane/Sugar Beet) can travel thousands of miles by sea or rail and still maintain a lower total carbon footprint than local corn moved by truck.
