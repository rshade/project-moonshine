# 🗺️ The Moonshine Run: Roadmap & Build Log

## 📐 Design Tracks (Form Factors)
### Track A: "The Rickhouse" (2U Rack Mount)
* **Target:** High-density Data Centers.
* **Constraint:** Height < 88mm.
* **Condenser:** Horizontal Axial.
* **Status:** 🟡 Conceptual Design

### Track B: "The Tower" (Vertical Desktop)
* **Target:** Home Lab / DIY.
* **Constraint:** 140mm footprint.
* **Advantage:** Gravity Feed (No Pump).
* **Status:** 🟡 Conceptual Design

## 🚧 Batch 1: The "White Dog" (Physics & Design)
* **Status:** 🟡 In Progress (Simulation Phase)
- [x] **Repo Setup:** Defensive Publication Live.
- [x] **Physics Engine:** Python Simulation (`moonshine-sim`) created.
- [x] **Sourcing Analysis:** Environmental impact & logistics model integrated.
- [ ] **Hardware Loop:** Build the physical Proof of Concept.

## 🔍 Discovery & Research (Parallel Tracks)
* **Fluid Purity & Denaturants:** 
    * [ ] **The "No Poison" Protocol:** Research sourcing 200-proof food-grade ethanol to eliminate methanol/gasoline denaturants (prevents seal degradation and boiling point shift).
* **Advanced Impact Metrics:**
    * [ ] **Water Scarcity Weighting:** Refine the "Weighted Water" model using real-world GIS data for corn/beet/cane regions.
    * [ ] **Land Use Analysis:** Analyze Carbon Debt (iLUC) for different feedstocks to ensure true carbon neutrality.
* **Thermal Storage & Hybrid Cycles:**
    * [ ] **Molten Salt Battery Integration:** Research capturing high-grade waste heat (steam/vapor) and residual heat into a molten salt thermal battery for energy storage and demand-response shifting.
* **Operations & Safety:****
    * [ ] **Supply Chain Resiliency:** Build a "Feedstock Agnostic" cost model to handle seasonal price volatility.
    * [ ] **Regulatory (NFPA) Mapping:** Map the 22°C flash point of the 60/40 mix to standard fire code storage limits for data centers.
* **Maintenance & Longevity:**
    * [ ] **Flushing Protocol ("The Wash"):** Define triggers (e.g., hours of operation, conductivity change, or color shift) for replacing the 60/40 mix and cleaning the "Bourbon Glaze" (precipitated oxides).
    * [ ] **Degradation Modeling:** Simulate fractional distillation risks—detecting if ethanol is escaping faster than water and shifting the boiling point.
    * [ ] **Intra-Loop Fractionation:** Model the "Continuous Still" effect—does the boiler become water-heavy while ethanol hangs out in the condenser?
* **Waste & Circularity:**
    * [ ] **Waste Disposal Validation:** Verify municipal sanitary sewer compliance for diluted ethanol disposal (The "Happy Hour" protocol).
    * [ ] **Glaze Recovery:** Research reclaiming copper oxides from the "Bourbon Glaze" byproduct for recycling or composting.
    * [ ] **Alternative Re-use:** Investigate if "The Flush" can be used as a cleaning agent or secondary fuel source before final disposal.

## ⚙️ Batch 2: The "Thumper" (Turbine Integration)
* **Status:** 🔴 Locked
- [ ] **Turbine Prototype:** 3D printed Tesla turbine testing.
- [ ] **Fluid Coupling:** Efficiency analysis of ethanol vapor vs turbine blades.
- [ ] **Hybrid Starter Motor:** Implement a small electric starter to overcome turbine stiction and achieve immediate RPM during the "Cold Start" phase (Addresses Pivot 4).

## 📦 Batch 3: The "Tunnel" (Axial Integration)
* **Status:** 🔴 Locked
- [ ] **Chassis Integration:** Finalizing the "Axial Condensing Tunnel" assembly.
- [ ] **Full Load Test:** 350W+ TDP stabilization.
